# PKTools-Rust
The Rust version of the PKTools framework, a project for practicing and improving coding but also creating useful classes with a physics theme.

## Running Examples
To build and run the examples in Linux or macOS you will need to install Rust with Cargo. Each class has an example (scripts of which are found in the `examples` directory) which can be run using the command:

```
cargo run --example <class-name>
```
